## Example Output
Example output for PewDiePie's statistics. In this example the client is connected to the room: UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw (PewDiePie's channel id). Note: This gif output is just an example. It can be different in newer versions of this repo!

## Starting the Websocket
Download this project into your folder and run
```
npm install
```
After that run index.js file to start the websocket
```
node index.js
```
Now your Websocket is running and listen to port 3000


## Connect Client and receive Data with pure JS
First import socket.io js file in your project like this
```javascript
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.2.0/socket.io.js"></script>
```
Now connect to your websocket
```javascript
var socket = io('localhost:3000');
```
Connect to a youtuber room (use the channel id of your selected youtuber). Same goes for switching to another youtuber
```javascript
socket.emit('room', 'UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw');
```
Get the channel data of this room. Just pass the same channel id like before to this function
```javascript
socket.on('UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw', function(channeldata) {
   console.log(channeldata); // object with channel data :-)
});
```

## Connect Client and receive Data with Angular 5.2.11 and RXJS 5.5.11
First install socket.io-client into your project
```javascript
npm install socket.io-client --save
```
Now create a provider/service for your project. Here is an example using the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/)
```javascript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
import { Observer } from 'rxjs/Observer';
import * as socketIo from 'socket.io-client';

@Injectable()
export class ChannelStatisticsProvider {

  private url:string = "http://localhost:3000";
  private room:string = "";
  private socket;

  /**
   * Connect to your Websocket
   */
  constructor() {
    this.socket = socketIo(this.url);
  }

  /**
   * Connect to a specified room
   * @param room -> channel id of your selected youtuber
   */
  public setRoom(room:string){
    this.socket.emit("room", room);
    this.room = room;
  }

  /**
   * Get Data from this room 
   * Observable to subscribe to your data and pass it to another function
   */
  public onUpdate(): Observable<object> {
    return new Observable<object> (observer => {
      this.socket.on(this.room, (data:object) => {
        observer.next(data);
      })
    });
  }
}
```
To use this provider anywhere in your project just inport it and declare it in your constructor like this:
```javascript
import { ChannelStatisticsProvider } from '<path-to-your-service-file>';

constructor(public channelProv: ChannelStatisticsProvider) {}
```
Now you can join a room or change to another room like this anywhere in your project:
```javascript
this.channelProv.setRoom("UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw");
```
And to get the data just subscribe to your onUpdate function like this
```javascript
this.channelProv.onUpdate().subscribe((data) => {
   //Object with channel statistics :) Every time you get a new update
   console.log("youtubechanneldata", data); 
})
```
